  <h1>Magnetism therapy</h1>
  <h2>What is magnetism therapy?</h2>

  <p>Each and every one of us has both positive and negative energy. If a person is blocked, this  will often manifest itself via stiff shoulders, vertebrae, etc. Other symptoms includes a feeling of tension in your stomach, throat and/or other physical complaints.</p>

  <p>Magnetism is actually a form of laying on of hands. This helps the person to regain the balance between body and mind, and helps remove any blocks.</p>

  <p>Various reactions may occur during or after treatment. The recipient may feel warmth, cold or a tingling sensation. They may also feel tired or fit, and feel like a weight has been taken off their shoulders.</p>

  <p>The therapist may also look at the underlying reasons for your physical complaints. However, please note: a magnetizer is not allowed to make a diagnosis. To receive a diagnosis you must consult a doctor.</p>
