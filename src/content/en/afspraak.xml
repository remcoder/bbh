    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>Please take the following steps to prepare for your massage.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For hygienic reasons, you may want to take a shower before your appointment.</li>

      <li>Make sure that you do not need to hurry to your appointment. To ensure that you are not rushed, you might consider a quick walk before your appointment.</li>

      <li>Switch off your telephone before entering the massage practice. This will prevent any disruption during treatment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After the treatment you will have the opportunity to regain yourself. You may want to have a glass of water as this will help to get rid of any toxins.</p>

    <h2>Cancelling an appointment</h2>

    <p>If you are unable to attend your appointment, please notify me as soon as possible. I require at least <em>24 hours</em>â€™ notice. If you do not cancel your appointment at least <em>24 hours</em> in advance, you will be charged a fee. Exceptional cases will be resolved in consultation between both parties.</p>

    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <p>Only cash payments are accepted. Please pay with the exact amount if possible. I do not have bank card or credit card facilities.</p>
